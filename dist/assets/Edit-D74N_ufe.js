I also focus on content, style, and language use. If you’re using an in-house style guide or APA, MLA, or Chicago style, I’ll ensure your project adheres to those guidelines.</p><h5>Proofreading</h5><p>Proofreading is the last edit before a project is published—this is where I&#39;ll check your work for any lingering typos or other small issues. </p><p>At the end of the editing process, you’ll receive an edited copy of your document, along with a summary explaining what changes I made, why I made them, and any patterns I noticed.</p><p>The cost of putting poorly edited work out into the world is astronomical—investing in edits ahead of time saves time, money, and embarrassment.</p><p><a href="https://calendly.com/the-writing-desk/free-consultation" target="_blank">Contact me</a> to get started!</p><br><a href="https://calendly.com/the-writing-desk/free-consultation" class="primary-button"><span>Contact Bailey</span></a></div></section><div><div><p class="quote white-bg"><i>&quot;I couldn&#39;t be more pleased to work with Bailey!
