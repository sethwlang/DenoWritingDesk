          Forged in the fires of corporate marketing.
          Shaped in the crucible of academia. Honed by the rigors of freelance writing and editing.

          Okay, it’s not that serious—but it sounds more impressive that way, doesn’t it?
          </p>
<p>
Truth is, I’ve been a word nerd since I first learned how to read (and that was a long, long time ago). 
</p>
<p>
I went from spelling bees and writing competitions to a creative writing undergraduate program and marketing for a multi-billion-dollar company. I then detoured into academia, where I earned an MA and PhD in rhetoric and writing, producing award-winning research and a book along the way. As a freelance writer, I became a chameleon. I wrote everything from chatty educational blog posts to buttoned-up investment advice. 
</p>
<h2>
Now, as a book coach, I combine all of my knowledge and experience with everything I love about teaching writing:
</h2>
<ul>
<li>Spending one-on-one time with writers, troubleshooting challenges, and watching them find the magic in their ideas.</li>
<li>Offering encouraging, constructive feedback that nudges authors toward being their best, most creative selves.</li>
<li>Creating custom writing practices that fit writers’ real lives, goals, and dreams.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I support writers of fiction and nonfiction alike through my book coaching services and my newsletter, Word to the Wise.

            <h2>
                Working with a book coach is a big undertaking. We’ll spend a lot of time together on a profoundly personal topic: your writing. How do you know if I’m the right coach for you?
</h2>
<p>
It’s not just about the credentials. My writing degrees and publishing experience aren’t the whole story. Finding the right book coach is also about the vibes. So, let’s do a quick vibe check, shall we?
</p>
<ul>
<li>My whole deal is partnering with writers to break through their creative blocks and see them fall in love with writing again. </li>
<li>I’m neurodivergent, so there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to anything around here. Writers and ideas that don’t fit the typical mold are my jam.</li>
<li>I’m a feminist and deeply committed to equity, justice, and democracy. I also recognize my many privileges and am equally committed to constant learning and making the Writing Desk a welcoming space. </li>
<li>I'm methodical—with a dash of witchcraft and fairy dust. We can talk logic, structure, and rules all day, and I am here for it. We can also pull a tarot card and do a breathing exercise. </li>
<li>I show up fully for each and every coaching interaction. My feedback is kind but no-nonsense, and I will push you to do your best writing!</li>
</ul>
<h2>
In turn, I love coaching writers who are:
</h2>
<ul>
<li>Committed to making progress on their books</li>
<li>Ready to put in the time to build new skills </li>
<li>Willing to incorporate constructive feedback</li>
<li>Prepared to invest in expert support </li>
<li>Curious, open-minded, respectful, and fun </li>
</ul>

<p>If that sounds like you, we should talk! </p>
