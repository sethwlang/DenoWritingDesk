          Okay, it’s not that serious—but it sounds more impressive that way, doesn’t it?
          </p>
<p>
Truth is, I’ve been a word nerd since I first learned how to read (and that was a long, long time ago). 
</p>
<p>
I went from spelling bees and writing competitions to a creative writing undergraduate program and marketing for a multi-billion-dollar company. I then detoured into academia, where I earned an MA and PhD in rhetoric and writing, producing award-winning research and a book along the way. As a freelance writer, I became a chameleon. I wrote everything from chatty educational blog posts to buttoned-up investment advice. 
</p>
<p>
Now, as a book coach, I combine all of my knowledge and experience with everything I love about teaching writing:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Spending one-on-one time with writers, troubleshooting challenges, and watching them find the magic in their ideas.</li>
<li>Offering encouraging, constructive feedback that nudges authors toward being their best, most creative selves.</li>
<li>Creating custom writing practices that fit writers’ real lives, goals, and dreams.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I support writers of fiction and nonfiction alike through my book coaching services and my newsletter, Word to the Wise.

Working with a book coach is a big undertaking. We’ll spend a lot of time together on a profoundly personal topic: your writing. How do you know if I’m the right coach for you? 
</p>
<p>
It’s not just about the credentials. My writing degrees and publishing experience aren’t the whole story. Finding the right book coach is also about the vibes. So, let’s do a quick vibe check, shall we?
</p>
<ul>
<li>My whole deal is partnering with writers to break through their creative blocks and see them fall in love with writing again. </li>
<li>I’m neurodivergent, so there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to anything around here. Writers and ideas that don’t fit the typical mold are my jam.</li>
<li>I’m a feminist and deeply committed to equity, justice, and democracy. I also recognize my many privileges and am equally committed to constant learning and making the Writing Desk a welcoming space. </li>
<li>Im methodical—with a dash of witchcraft and fairy dust. We can talk logic, structure, and rules all day, and I am here for it. We can also pull a tarot card and do a breathing exercise. </li>
<li>I show up fully for each and every coaching interaction. My feedback is kind but no-nonsense, and I will push you to do your best writing!</li>
</ul>
<p>
In turn, I love coaching writers who are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Committed to making progress on their books</li>
<li>Ready to put in the time to build new skills </li>
<li>Willing to incorporate constructive feedback</li>
<li>Prepared to invest in expert support </li>
<li>Curious, open-minded, respectful, and fun </li>
</ul>

<p>If that sounds like you, we should talk! </p>
