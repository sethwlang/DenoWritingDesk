          <h1>Magic happens at The Writing Desk.</h1>
          <p>Pull up a comfy chair and grab your fanciest notebook. It’s time to write. </p>
          <h2>Let’s tell a story that matters. </h2>
          <img src="/images/LandingPage.jpg"
               alt="An image of Bailey"
               class="float-image-home"
          />
          <p>Your story.</p>
          <p>You know the one: the book you’ve been waiting to start until you have more free time, or inspiration
              strikes, or you finally feel ready.
          </p>
          <p>I’ll let you in on a secret. The free time isn’t coming, the Muse is waiting on you, and no writer is ever
              truly ready. The real magic is knowing all that and figuring out how to write anyway. The best way to tap
              into
              that magic?
          </p>
          <p>Sitting down at The Writing Desk, of course.</p>
          <p>You deserve a writing practice that meets your needs and supports your best work. A writing practice that
              fuels your creativity and makes writing your book—dare I say it?—fun. </p>
          <p>At the Writing Desk, we’ll build that practice together. </p>
          <p>Working with a book coach opens the portal to a deeply personalized, sustainable writing practice.
              Together,
              we’ll take your book from draft to done. </p>
