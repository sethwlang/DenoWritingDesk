                        <p>
                            I get it—sometimes, you just need somebody to talk to about writing. Maybe you’re dealing
                            with writer’s block or a wonky schedule and need suggestions for shaking the words loose
                            when the
                            world is getting in the way. Perhaps you have the seed of a nonfiction book, and you’re
                            craving
                            a gut check—will this idea work? Or maybe your characters aren’t behaving, and you have no
                            clue
                            how to get your novel back on track.
