                                    I get it—sometimes, you just need somebody to talk to about writing. Maybe you’re
                                    dealing
                                    with writer’s block or a wonky schedule and need suggestions for shaking the words
                                    loose
                                    when the
                                    world is getting in the way. Perhaps you have the seed of a nonfiction book, and
                                    you’re
                                    craving
                                    a gut check—will this idea work? Or maybe your characters aren’t behaving, and you
                                    have
                                    no

                                    Writing a book is a major undertaking, and you don’t have to do it alone. I’ll be in

                                    and we’ll be laser-focused on two key components: your writing practice and your
                                    command of the craft.
                                    I’ll give you extensive feedback so you sharpen your writing and make real progress.

                                    For nonfiction, we’ll ensure your book employs compelling storytelling strategies
                                    and a structure
                                    that keeps readers turning the page. For novels, we’ll focus on character, story
                                    arc, and essential plot beats.

                                    lives for the better. You have the expertise; you’ve done the research; your idea
                                    can
                                    walk
                                    the walk. What you don’t have is the time to write an entire book.

                                    That’s where I come in. As a ghostwriter, I’ll step as fully into your shoes as
                                    possible,
                                    learning to tell your stories in your voice. You bring the idea; I bring the
                                    research,
                                    writing,
                                    and publishing experience. Together, we make a book you can be proud of.

                                <p>We’ll collaborate throughout the process, from ideation to putting the finishing
                                    touches
                                    on
                                    the manuscript.
                                    Expect many touchpoints, opportunities to offer feedback, and deep conversations
                                    with
                                    me.
                                    I primarily work on educational, business-oriented books with a strong research
                                    component.
